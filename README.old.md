# Bevy Software Engineering Coding Assessment

Thanks again for your interest in Bevy, and for taking the time to do this assessment.

## Rules
We want you to give us the best possible sample of work, so you are allowed to use any tools or resources at your disposal. Just use common sense and please don’t submit plagiarized work. For example: asking someone else to do the work for you or forking someone else's repo and turning it in as your own work. However, using starter projects or scripts is welcome to save you time in setting up the application base as long as they are referenced and documented.

## Technical Requirements
Work will only be accepted in Javascript or TypeScript. Bevy primarily uses React, and NextJS. However, it's fine to use Vue, Angular, or similar frameworks, or just use the languages standard library. Use of UI component libraries such as Material-UI or Ant Design are also welcome.

## Timeline
We understand that many people have commitments outside of work that can make it challenging to find the time to do an assessment. At the same time, work samples are one of the most predictive ways for an employer to assess a candidate, even if it slows down the interview process. With that in mind, we request that you complete this assessment within one week of receiving it. However, the sooner you turn it in the sooner we can get to the next interview round and a potential offer of employment. If you need to renegotiate that timeline that's ok! Just let us know and we will work with you. However, if we don’t hear anything from you within one week, we will assume you found another role and close your application. This assessment is intended to take three to four hours to get an MVP version and has plenty of opportunities to go above and beyond.

## Grading and Evaluation
Bevy engineers will review your submission. We will evaluate if each of the objectives has been implemented, how efficiently it was implemented (algorithmically and software patterns/design), how you can be sure that it works (like tests), how you handled edge cases, and how well you followed best practices for the technologies you used. Your submission will be graded holistically, so don’t worry too much if you don’t feel good about a specific part of your solution. In the next round, we will certainly discuss the pros and cons of your solution and the reasoning behind your technical decisions.

## Prerequisites
You will need to set up a Free Socrata API Token. This can be found on the Socrata API doc page linked below.

Please use this repository to do work as you would normally. Feel free to use branches, issues, and pull requests however you see fit.

## Project
The project and communication with Bevy team members will be done via GitHub issue(s). Great communication is one of our core values and is a strong indicator of one's ability to thrive in a remote working environment, so please make use of the existing issue, or create new ones as necessary. Not only are we here to help guide and clarify things to enable you to do your best work, but it's a great opportunity for you to assess some of Bevy's culture and communication for yourself!

Please visit [Issue #1](https://github.com/bevy-interviews/stefania-arias-fe-sse-project/issues/1) for project objectives and to get started! Good luck!
